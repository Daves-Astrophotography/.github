# Hi there 👋, welcome to Dave's Astrophotography

### This is a place for all code things related to my astro projects.
   
   
And here is an image I captured. This is the Iris Nebula NGC 7023, and was captured with the Rasa11, ASI2600MC-P and has 9hr 45min total integration time, shot over 3 nights.
